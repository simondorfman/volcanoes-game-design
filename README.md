This is where I ask and answer questions about [Volcanoes](https://simondorfman.com/volcanoes1), a game design in progress.

## Question #1

### Which of these four rules seems to make the game the most balanced?:

(And by balanced, I mean less likely to give the first player or the second player advantage.)

1. Award tie games to the player that played the last turn.
2. Award tie games to the player that did not play the last turn.
3. Award tie games to the first player.
4. Award tie games to the second player.

(This question was originally articulated [here](https://github.com/skotz/volcanoes/issues/49#issuecomment-722127185).)

Sidenote: Why not let ties be ties? Because I want the games to be decisive.
